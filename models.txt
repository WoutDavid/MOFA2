first_model:
    -ATAC split in distal/promotor
    -default model options
    -5000 findVariableFeatures for all assays
    -no motif matrix added

    Model options:
    - Automatic Relevance Determination prior on the factors: False
    - Automatic Relevance Determination prior on the weights: True
    - Spike-and-slab prior on the factors: False
    - Spike-and-slab prior on the weights: True 

    Likelihoods:
    - View 0 (RNA): gaussian
    - View 1 (ATAC_distal): gaussian
    - View 2 (ATAC_promoter): gaussian

second_model:
    - Motif enrichment added
    - default model options
    - 5000 findVariableFeatures for both RNA
    - 1000 min.cutoff for ATAC seq, cause 600 left too many features, mofa asked
      to perform more stringent cutoff
    - quality control added
    model options and likelihoods: 
    - same as first
